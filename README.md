## 🚜 Problem Statement

Farmers often face challenges due to a lack of scientific guidance on fertilizer use, resulting in:

- Nutrient imbalances and reduced crop yields.
- Soil degradation and pollution from overuse.
- Rising fertilizer costs—up to 18% of small farmers' total expenses.
- Reliance on finite resources like phosphate rock (risk of “peak phosphorus”).

> 🌍 Over 40–60% of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers are wasted, polluting water bodies and releasing nitrous oxide—a greenhouse gas 300× stronger than CO₂.

## 🌾 Our Solution

**AgriCure** is a smart fertilizer recommendation system that uses **real-time IoT sensors** and **machine learning** to provide tailored fertilizer advice. It ensures:

- Better crop growth and yield
- Optimal input use
- Environment-friendly farming

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. ESP32 collects real-time sensor data (NPK, pH, moisture, temperature, etc.)
2. Sends data via HTTP to the backend server
3. Python ML model processes and compares with ideal crop requirements
4. Backend returns fertilizer recommendations
5. Dashboard displays insights for farmers
